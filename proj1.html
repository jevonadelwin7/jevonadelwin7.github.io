    <a href="">During the pandemic, sadly Atma Jaya couldn't hold their first executive student body election physically. Therefore me and my friends was trusted to make a web-based system that allowed students to vote online.
        During the project, I was responsible for designing and implementing the system's database, while also making sure its back-end runs smoothly.
        The election ran smoothly thanks to the system's help, and it has been an amazing exploratory experience to expand my knowledge in this field.</a>
